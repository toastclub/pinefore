Thank you for considering contributing. Given the nature of this project, there's a few things we need to get out of the way.

The open release is designed to be used alongside a proprietary project, and may contain references to this proprietary code. For this reason, contributions may be difficult in some circumstances, but are more than welcome. If you are interested in significant contributions to the project, contact us and we can discuss offering you a contract.

By contributing, you grant Toastcat LLC a non-exclusive, perpetual, worldwide, irrevocable, royalty-free, sub-licensable license to use, reproduce, modify, distribute, and sublicense the contributions in any way.
