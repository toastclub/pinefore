# 2024

## September

  - Finish tag editing
  - ‚Üí 15th: Note support in API
  - Feed updating in API

  - Beginning tag editing
  - Fix for the previous two issues
- While we‚Äôve had a functioning feed backend for a week, the first OPML import was completed successfully on the 6th. This exposed a number of issues
  - Minor: a great deal of issues in our feed parser have been identified
  - Major: on conflict do nothing increments entity primary keys, which resulted in breakneck increments (at a rate of about 100k per hour). A script was created to collapse these gaps, and for the runtime of the script (some ~2s), information was potentially lost. A patch has not yet been created, so RSS fetching has been disabled
- 6th: OPML importing
- 5th: Fix login bug where captcha was consumed and not regenerated
- View transitions
- Continued support for feeds
  - Send new items to queue right away
  - Viewing them on frontend
  - Queues now work 

## August

August flew by under the radar. Most of the work done was to set ourselves up for success in the future. We added strong testing frameworks, and subdivided our code. In addition, RSS is now supported on the backend. There have been no frontend changes, due to a long standing bug in the development environment. The project initially was in a rapid back-and-forth state where changes could be seen happening daily, but now I prefer to focus on one at a time.

- 23rd-30th: Begin feeds on the frontend; stripe support
  - Feeds are coming along nicely, the API works quite well and only minor issues have been identified
  - Stripe blocked by em_8mhgm6zkdyx8sh5wpbxayxkbatdk0w
- 21st: Embeddings for reccomendations
- 18th-19th: Integration test framework; many integration & unit tests (~15% coverage)
- 11th-???: Various changes to CRON; Queues; RSS; and Archives.
- 10th: Root domain filtering
- 4th-14th: Huge internal migration began. The backend and frontend used to be deployed together, but now they are separate, with their own `package.json`. This should help security and should make control much easier due to less bundling.
- 4th, 5th: OG image generation
- 3rd: Toasts for error messages
- 1st-3rd: Bugfixes
