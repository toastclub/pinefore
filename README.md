<img align="left" width="300px" src="https://pinefore.com/branding/widelogo.svg"/> Pinefore is a new type of internet service, or rather, an old one revitalized for a modern era. It is an internet service that, from the very beginning, has been designed consciously in ways that empower our users. It is a service that intends to foster diversity in our web, at a time when the largest companies are attacking it. It is the result of hundreds of hours spent examining the cultural shifts between 2000-2015. We pine for beautiful gardens of home grown content — bastions of individuality. Through every method possible, our goal is to encourage their growth.

Pinefore plans to launch with full protocol support for _ActivityPub_ (est. 2018); _Delicious/Pinboard_ (est. 2005); _RSS_ (est. 1999); _Google Reader_ (est. 2005); _Fever_ (est. 2013). Soon, we will add support for _WebMention_; _???_

We currently are launching with tightly integrated and communal: _Bookmarking_, _RSS_, and _Annotations_; and we plan to add support for: _Croundfunding_ à la Coil, "_Small Search_", and Anything else that could foster the indieweb

We are not taking investments. That would be contrary to our goals.

## OSS

Given the nature of our service, most of our "proprietary technology" would be beneficial to the web community as a whole. As a result, we've open sourced most of the interesting bits. We believe a rising tide lifts all boats. All the code here is identical to what is in production.

OSS has the following additional advantages:

- Documentation is inherently more ambiguous than code
- Users can verify their data is stored responsibly

## Notes

- There are no docs here. That's due to an edgecase in our build system, arising from symlinks
- Contributions are accepted, however local development is expected to be difficult
- The database schema is not included
- The package.json is currently not included, due to the file system structure
