# AI

We have periodically experimented with AI for the following purposes:

| Topic                                                       | Status                                                     |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Generating titles when there is no title (eg Twit or Masto) | ðŸ™ˆ [Suspended](https://social.coop/@eb/112797743728441302) |

- ðŸ™ˆ Suspended: The experiment has been suspended and is not currently active on the live site
- ðŸš§ In Progress: The experiment is currently in development
- âœ… Completed: The experiment has been completed and is currently active on the live site

We've experimented with AI when it [enhances user experience](https://boehs.org/node/old-tech), but we have not found, thus far, applications of it that outweigh the following concerns:

1. **Training**: AI companies train on data that was not collected with consent, which is against our values
2. **Energy Consumption**: AI burns immense amounts of energy. We have not found applications of AI that's worth the energy it consumes
3. **Hallucination**: If AI generates incorrect information, that will have disastrous consequences for our community.
